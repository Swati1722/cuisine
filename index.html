        <h2>Indian cuisines</h2>
        <p>The cuisine of India is one of the world's most diverse cuisines, characterized by its sophisticated and subtle use of the many spices, vegetables, grains and fruits grown across India. The cuisine of each geographical region includes a wide assortment of dishes and cooking techniques reflecting the varied demographics of the ethnically diverse Indian subcontinent. India's religious beliefs and culture have played an influential role in the evolution of its cuisine. Vegetarianism is widely practiced in many Hindu, Buddhist and Jain communities.
            <br>
        India’s unique blend of cuisines evolved through large-scale cultural interactions with neighboring Persia, ancient Greece, Mongols and West Asia. New World foods such as chili peppers, tomatoes, potatoes and squash, introduced by Arab and Portuguese traders during the sixteenth century, and European cooking styles introduced during the colonial period added to the diversity of Indian cuisine.</p>

        <h2> Chinese cuisines</h2>
        <p>In a country where the traditional way to greet someone translates to 'have you eaten yet?' (ni chile ma), be rest assured, the food will be extraordinary. China has the most popular culinary heritage in the world. The history of their cuisine dates back to about 1000 years with varied cooking styles, techniques and ingredients that have evolved over time.A typical Chinese meal will have two things - a carbohydrate or starch like noodles, rice or buns, and accompanying stir fries or dishes of veggies, fish and meat. They use a lot of fresh vegetables like mushroom, water chestnuts, bamboo and even tofu. In North China, wheat-based accompaniments like noodles and steamed buns dominate the table, in contrast to South China where rice is a favourite. The short-grain sticky rice, grown throughout Southern China, is absolutely irresistible.Each dish focuses on creating a balance between three aspects - appearance, aroma, and taste. They pay a lot of attention to the aesthetic appearance of the food with diversified colours. Sauces and seasonings like fish sauce, five spice powder, oyster sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, root garlic, fresh ginger and others are used generously to offer a complex play of flavour and aroma.Much like Japanese cuisine, Chinese dishes are rich in umami which is described as a 'pleasant savory taste'. The umami taste is common to many ingredients used in their cuisine like Chinese cabbage, spinach, celery, green tea or fermented products like soy sauce and pastes.Chinese food and the way it is prepared is influenced by the two major philosophies - Confucianism and Taoism. One of the standards set by Confucius was that food must be cut into small bite- size pieces before being served. Those who follow Taoism focus more on food that promote health and longevity and those that have healing powers.</p>

        <h2>German cuisines</h2>
        <p>German food is far from the healthiest, with bread and meat at nearly every meal. Still, traditional hearty German food is quite enjoyable, from appetizing dumplings to Wursts (sausages) to delicious pastries. Spatzle, thick German pasta usually topped with cheese, and potatoes fried with oil, bacon, and onions are common sides to meaty dishes. Carrots, turnips, spinach, peas, beans, and cabbage are commonly added to soups and stews, while asparagus is another common side dish. Outside of mustard or horseradish condiments, dishes are rarely spicy and tend to use herbs like parsley, chives, and thyme.</p>

        <h2> French cuisines </h2>
        <p>
        French cuisine developed throughout the centuries influenced by the many surrounding cultures of Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, in addition to its own food traditions on the long western coastlines of the Atlantic, the Channel and of course, inland.
        <br>
        In the 14th century, Guillaume Tirel, a court chef known as "Taillevent", wrote Le Viandier, one of the earliest recipe collections of medieval France. In the 17th century, chefs François Pierre La Varenne and Marie-Antoine Carême spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style.

        <h2> Italian cuisines</h2>
        <p>
            Italian cuisine is a Mediterranean cuisine[1] consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora.[2][3][4]

            Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet - the latter introduced in quantity in the 18th century.]Italian cuisine is known for its regional diversity, especially between the north and the south of Italy.It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied in the world.[10] It influenced several cuisines around the world, chiefly that of the United States.
            
            Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients.[12] Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.[13] Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country

        <h2> Korean cuisines</h2>
        <p>
        Korean cuisine is the customary cooking traditions and practices of the culinary arts of Korea. Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine has evolved through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.[1][2]

        Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, seafood and (at least in the South) meats. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes  that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochugaru (pepper flakes), gochujang (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage.
